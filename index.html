        <h3>How does it work?</h3>
        <p>
          Cat coffee is both a coffee shop and a cat adoption center. For that
          purpose, we partner with 3 local shelters
        </p>
        <p>
          For a $10 fee, customers can stay in the lounge for a full hour. The
          fee allows us to provide care for the 5 cats waiting for their
          furrever home! We also take reservations, however beware that cats
          sleep upwards to 20 hours a day so we encourage you to manage
          expectations and enjoy the unique experience of simply appreciating
          our feline friends for all of their unique personalities.
        </p>
        <p>
          We offer a small selection of beverages and snacks, but do keep an eye
          on them as our feline friends are very playful...

          All the cats in the café come from local shelters, so if you come by
          and find yourself attached to one of them, let us know! Adoptions are
          handled via an application, so don't hesitate to ask our staff!

        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
        <h4>Can I share my food with the cats?</h4>
        <p>
          No, we cannot guarantee food that is 100% cat-friendly so please, keep
          an eye on your food and don't let any of the cats get their paws on
          it!
        </p>
        <h4>Does the entry fee cover all food and beverages?</h4>
        <p>
          No, the fee is exclusively for the care of the cats. Any food or
          beverage purchased comes at an additional price
        </p>
        <h4>Are childrens allowed?</h4>
        <p>
          Yes! Children of all ages are welcome, but keep in mind that this is
          also a sanctuary for our furry friends, so please keep any noise at a
          reasonable level.
        </p>
        <h4>Can I play with the cats?</h4>
        <p>
          Yes! We only ask that you respect the cat's body language: if a cat is
          sleeping or trying to create distance, respect it and let them come to
          you. If you have any doubt, don't hesitate to ask the staff for any
          pointers
        </p>
        <h4>Can I bring my dog?</h4>
        <p>
          Dogs and any other pet are not allowed within the lounge as we try to
          create a peaceful and stress-free environment for the cats
        </p>
